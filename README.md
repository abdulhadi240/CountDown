# CountDown
The project is a simple countdown built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage displays a countdown timer that counts down to a specific date and time. The user can enter their desired countdown date and time, and the timer will update accordingly. The design of the webpage is minimalist, with a clean and elegant color scheme that makes the timer easy to read. The HTML and CSS work together to create the visual layout and design of the timer, while the JavaScript handles the countdown functionality. This project is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create an interactive and functional web application.
